# Introduction

Business model innovation (BMI) is a key activity to maintain competitiveness and even gain a competitive advantage [@pucihar_drivers_2019,@teece_business_2018]. It is therefore no surprise that the interest in BMI and methods of measuring it has grown rapidly over the last twenty years. Researchers have recently called for a BMI measurement instrument that is more comprehensive and advanced than already existing ones [@huang_review_2023]. The scale developed by [@spieth_business_2016] provides managers and practitioners with a measurement index for business model innovativeness. This measurement model only validates applicability of BMI theory [@huang_review_2023] and is insufficient for longitudinal studies [@clauss_measuring_2017]. Hence, this measure is not adequate for a time series analysis of BMI. Furthermore, it refers only to BMI as new-to-the-firm and is not able to grasp BMI in the sense of new-to-the-industry and new-to-market.

-	Solution approach (both after we actually are final with approach and have (some) results)

-	Results

We contribute in multiple ways. First we apply a more modern text-mining technique than Lee and Hong (2014) and Hoberg and Phillips (2016) to extract the business model from 10-K filings. Second, we propose a new measure for BMI which is sufficient for longitudinal studies and able to measure BMI on a new-to-the-industry level.

## Business Model Innovation

In spite of the growing interest in BMI and the increasing number of theoretical and empirical studies in this field, the research of BMI is still in a prelaminar state [@huang_review_2023]. Consequently, this study focuses on literature pertaining to the measurement of BMI. [@spieth_business_2016] identify three core dimensions a company’s business model is comprised of: its value proposition, its value creation architecture and its revenue model logic. Based on this, BMI is conceptualised as a change that is new-to-the-firm in at least one of these dimensions. Furthermore, [@spieth_business_2016] introduce a measurement model to evaluate these three dimensions of BMI. They develop an index by first specifying the contents, followed by a specifiaction of the indicators and assessing their content validity, assessing the indicators collinearity and finally assessing the external validity. In total, twelve indicators for measuring the innovativeness of the business model were identified by a literature review and entering in a dialog with practitioners. The external validity of the formative indicators was successfully validated by questioning 200 strategy and innovation management experts. [@clauss_measuring_2017] follows a very similar approach. After specifying the domain and dimensionality of BMI trough a literature research, the author divides the scale into three hierarchical levels consisting of 41 reflective items, 10 subconstructs and three main dimensions, which are similar to the ones mentioned earlier. The scale is validated through two large-scale samples from the manufacturing industry and further demonstrated nomological validity [@clauss_measuring_2017].
