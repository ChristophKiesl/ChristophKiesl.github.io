\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Business model innovation (BMI) is a key activity to maintain
competitiveness and even gain a competitive advantage (Pucihar et al.
2019; Teece 2018). It is therefore no surprise that the interest in BMI
and methods of measuring it has grown rapidly over the last twenty
years. Researchers have recently called for a BMI measurement instrument
that is more comprehensive and advanced than already existing ones
(Huang and Ichikohji 2023). The scale developed by Spieth \& Schneider
(2016) provides managers and practitioners with a measurement index for
business model innovativeness. This measurement model only validates
applicability of BMI theory (Huang and Ichikohji 2023) and is
insufficient for longitudinal studies (Clauss 2017). Hence, this measure
is not adequate for a time series analysis of BMI. Furthermore, it
refers only to BMI as new-to-the-firm and is not able to grasp BMI in
the sense of new-to-the-industry and new-to-market. Clauss (2017)
developed a similar measure with comparable limitations.

This gap is addressed by proposing a novel approach to measuring BMI.
US-based companies are obliged by the Security and Exchange Commission
(SEC) to submit annual 10-K filings, wherein a detailed description of
the company's business operations is required. Hoberg \& Phillips (2016)
use this filings to create word vectors about the companies products in
order to cluster them into industries and thereby proposing a new
industry classification. This study builds on their work and methods. We
summarize these descriptions with Gemini, utilize the BERTScore as a
similarity measure to calculate the similarities between companies and
cluster them into industries. We compare our BERTScore clustering with
the TNIC clustering by Hoberg \& Phillips (2016). Furthermore, we
calculate the BERTScore between the summaries of different years for a
single company. This approach enables the measurement of changes in the
BM over time as the distance between the BM summary of one year to
another. There is evidence that an increase in BMI is associated with
improved firm performance (Cucculelli and Bettinelli 2015; Latifi,
Nikou, and Bouwman 2021; White et al. 2022). In order to test the
validity of our measure, we regress financial numbers on our measure,
hoping to find a positive relationship.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Key findings (and Contribution, already down below)
\end{itemize}

Our contribution is made in a number of ways. Firstly, we tackle two
issues raised in the study by Lee \& Hong (2014): we employ a more
reliable and contemporary methodology for extracting the business model
(BM) from 10-K filings and we are able to extend the scope of their
study. Secondly, we build on the concept of alternative industry
classification put forth by Hoberg \& Phillips (2016) and propose an
industry classification system based on a firm's BM. Thirdly, we propose
a novel measure for BMI that is sufficient for longitudinal studies.

The SEC requires most public US-based companies to hand in certain
documents in certain intervals. One of these documents are the annual
10-K filings. These filings follow a set order of topics and contain
information for example about managerial discussions, risk factors for
the company, legal proceedings and financial data. In the first section
under the subtitle ``Business'', a company states its general business
which includes information about its products and services and in some
cases further topics like labor issues or competition (SEC 2024). In
conclusion, this section contains the most useful information to
describe a company's BM (Lee and Hong 2014). Furthermore, 10-K filings
are a reliable source, since US-law prohibits false or misleading
statements in the filings. The SEC monitors the compliance of the
companies with the requirements and comments where disclosure appears to
be inconsistent (SEC 2024).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  paragraph 5 (robustness checks)
\end{itemize}

In spite of the growing interest in BMI and the increasing number of
theoretical and empirical studies in this field, the research of BMI is
still in a preliminary state (Huang and Ichikohji 2023). Consequently,
there is considerable variation in the definitions of BMI, with some
definitions being more similar to one another than others (Foss and
Saebi 2017). Spieth \& Schneider (2016) identify three core dimensions a
company's BM is comprised of: its value proposition, its value creation
architecture and its revenue model logic. Based on this, BMI can be
conceptualized as a change that is new-to-the-firm in at least one of
these dimensions. Furthermore, Spieth and Schneider (2016) introduce a
measurement model to evaluate these three dimensions of BMI. They
develop an index by first specifying the contents, followed by a
specification of the indicators and assessing their content validity,
assessing the indicators collinearity and finally assessing the external
validity. A total of twelve indicators for measuring the innovativeness
of the BM were identified through a comprehensive literature review and
through engagement with industry practitioners. The external validity of
the formative indicators was successfully validated through a survey of
200 experts in strategy and innovation management (Spieth and Schneider
2016). Clauss (2017) employs a very similar approach. After specifying
the domain and dimensionality of BMI trough literature research, the
author divides his scale into three hierarchical levels consisting of 41
reflective items, 10 subconstructs and three main dimensions, which are
similar to the ones mentioned earlier. The scale was validated through
two samples from the manufacturing industry and further demonstrated
nomological validity (Clauss 2017). However, both measures are subject
to three significant limitations. Firstly, both measures lack a temporal
component. Consequently, they are inadequate for use in longitudinal
studies or ex-post evaluations of BMI. Secondly, BMI is only measured at
the new-to-the-firm level rather than at the new-to-the-industry or
new-to-the-market level. Thirdly, both measures rely on interviews and
questionnaires, which makes conducting large-scale studies
time-consuming and reliant on the willingness of the companies to
cooperate (Clauss 2017; Spieth and Schneider 2016).

The process of text mining 10-K filings is not a novel concept. Hoberg
\& Phillips (2016) present a novel approach to defining industry
boundaries. This is achieved through the parsing of the product
descriptions provided by firm 10-K filings and creating word vectors.
Specifically, the authors identify and exclude proper nouns, which
include common words and geographic locations.They then create word
vectors for each firm and year, which enables the measurement of product
similarity over time. In this way the authors demonstrate shortcomings
in the traditional industry classification systems such as the Standard
Industry Classification (SIC) and the North American Industry
Classification System (NAICS), which are not able to account for
temporal changes. The new method is capable of capturing changes in
industry boundaries and competitor sets over time, thereby providing a
dynamic industry classification system. In their study, Lee \& Hong
(2014) examine the evolution of a firm's BM over time. The authors
represent each document as a vector of keywords, which is similar to the
approach utilized by Hoberg \& Phillips (2016). After identifying the
Item 1 part of the 10-K filings as the most crucial part for describing
a firm's BM, Lee \& Hong (2014) filter these for relevant sentences.
Subsequently, the authors construct keyword vectors, which represent the
concept of the BM. Therefore, the evolution of the BM is depicted as the
change in the distribution of keywords over time. Nevertheless, this
approach is not without shortcomings. The authors advocate for a more
robust methodology, such as incorporating multi-word phrases in the
keyword vectors, to enhance the reliability of the approach (Lee and
Hong 2014).

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the
preprocessing with Gemini, our data and our methodology. Section 3
compares the industry classification based on product descriptions by
Hoberg \& Phillips (2016) with our classification based on the BM.
Section 4 lays out the BERT-model and our estimations. Section 5
discusses our results, and Section 6 concludes our study.

\section{Data and Methodology}\label{data-and-methodology}

\subsection{Preprocessing with Gemini}\label{preprocessing-with-gemini}

As previously stated, 10-K filings are typically very large text
documents, and Item 1 of these filings is no exception. Table 1 shows
the deskriptive measures of the length of the original Item 1 section in
our final sample. The length of a document was measured by the word
count without punctuation. The document length ranges from a couple
hundred words to tens of thousands. In order to utilise the entirety of
the information regarding the BM in the Item 1 section and pass the text
to our BERT model, we decided to let Google's GenAI chatbot Gemini
summarize them to a maximum length of 512 tokens. The summaries were
created between 26 June 2024 and 6 August 2024. The model employed was
Gemini Flash 1.5. The prompt was inserted at the beginning of each text
file and it was passed via an API to Gemini \footnote{We forked and used
  following Github Repository: https://github.com/skranz/gemini\_ex.}.
We used following prompt: ``Summarize the business model from the
following text. Answer with a continuous text and with five hundred
twelve tokens at max. Set your focus on sources of revenue, the intended
customer base, products, distribution channels and details of financing.
Use only information from the following the text''.\footnote{The
  spelling error in the last sentence of the prompt was found after
  processing the Item 1. After evaluating the Summaries, this error did
  not cause any issues.} ``intended customer base'' and ``product''
refer to the value offering, ``distribution channels'' refers to the
value architecture, and ``sources of revenue'' and ``details of
financing'' refer to the revenue model. Consequently, this prompt covers
all aspects of the definition of BMI proposed by Spieth \& Schneider
(2016). The term `tokens' was used deliberately in preference to
`words', given that the number of tokens and the number of words in a
text may vary depending on the tokeniser. This way, we wanted to ensure
that the whole summary is used by the BERT model. To assess the quality
and accuracy of the summaries produced by Gemini, a random sample of 100
filings was selected for comparison with the original text. More
precise,the original file was initially read with a focus on the points
mentioned in the prompt. Subsequently, the summary was evaluated to
ascertain whether it contained these same points. A list of the sample
with the summaries is provided in the Appendix.

\subsection{The Dataset}\label{the-dataset}

We collect 10-Ks filings from the digital SEC Database, using the
category ``10-K'' as extraction condition. Since the focus of our study
lies on company's BM, we only use the Item 1 part, since this is the
most crucial part of the 10-K filings for describing the companies BM
(Lee and Hong 2014).

//Our observations are limited to an intersection of such companies,
which on the one hand has been made available to the SEC since 2001 in a
publicly accessible list of 10.284 companies (Appendix), of which 7590
are listed (on stock exchange). On the other hand, we consider companies
that filed 10-K reports with the SEC between 2017 and 2023
//-\textgreater{} rewrite as step by step, how we got to the final list
of companies

We exclude companies from the financial sector, namely companies with a
SIC Code starting with six. We consider the filings from 2017 to 2023.
