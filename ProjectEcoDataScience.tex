\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Business model innovation (BMI) is a key activity to maintain
competitiveness and even gain a competitive advantage (Pucihar et al.
2019; Teece 2018). It is therefore no surprise that the interest in BMI
and methods of measuring it has grown rapidly over the last twenty
years. Researchers have recently called for a BMI measurement instrument
that is more comprehensive and advanced than already existing ones
(Huang and Ichikohji 2023). The scale developed by Spieth \& Schneider
(2016) provides managers and practitioners with a measurement index for
business model innovativeness. This measurement model only validates
applicability of BMI theory (Huang and Ichikohji 2023) and is
insufficient for longitudinal studies (Clauss 2017). Hence, this measure
is not adequate for a time series analysis of BMI. Furthermore, it
refers only to BMI as new-to-the-firm and is not able to grasp BMI in
the sense of new-to-the-industry and new-to-market.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Research Question and approach (both after we actually are final with
  approach and have (some) results)
\item
  Key findings and Contribution Our contribution is made in a number of
  ways. Firstly, we tackle two issues raised in the study by Lee \& Hong
  (2014): we employ a more reliable and contemporary methodology for
  extracting the business model (BM) from 10-K filings and we are able
  to extend the scope of their study. Secondly, we build on the concept
  of alternative industry classification put forth by Hoberg \& Phillips
  (2016) and propose an industry classification system based on a firm's
  BM. Thirdly, we propose a novel measure for BMI that is sufficient for
  longitudinal studies.
\item
  paragraph 4 What are 10-K filings? Describe the data source and our
  way of using the Data (only brief)
\item
  paragraph 5 (robustness checks)
\end{itemize}

In spite of the growing interest in BMI and the increasing number of
theoretical and empirical studies in this field, the research of BMI is
still in a preliminary state (Huang and Ichikohji 2023). Consequently,
there is considerable variation in the definitions of BMI, with some
definitions being more similar to one another than others (Foss and
Saebi 2017). Spieth \& Schneider (2016) identify three core dimensions a
company's BM is comprised of: its value proposition, its value creation
architecture and its revenue model logic. Based on this, BMI can be
conceptualized as a change that is new-to-the-firm in at least one of
these dimensions. Furthermore, Spieth and Schneider (2016) introduce a
measurement model to evaluate these three dimensions of BMI. They
develop an index by first specifying the contents, followed by a
specification of the indicators and assessing their content validity,
assessing the indicators collinearity and finally assessing the external
validity. A total of twelve indicators for measuring the innovativeness
of the BM were identified through a comprehensive literature review and
through engagement with industry practitioners. The external validity of
the formative indicators was successfully validated through a survey of
200 experts in strategy and innovation management (Spieth and Schneider
2016). Clauss (2017) employs a very similar approach. After specifying
the domain and dimensionality of BMI trough literature research, the
author divides his scale into three hierarchical levels consisting of 41
reflective items, 10 subconstructs and three main dimensions, which are
similar to the ones mentioned earlier. The scale was validated through
two samples from the manufacturing industry and further demonstrated
nomological validity (Clauss 2017). However, both measures are subject
to three significant limitations. Firstly, both measures lack a temporal
component. Consequently, they are inadequate for use in longitudinal
studies or ex-post evaluations of BMI. Secondly, BMI is only measured at
the new-to-the-firm level rather than at the new-to-the-industry or
new-to-the-market level. Thirdly, both measures rely on interviews and
questionnaires, which makes conducting large-scale studies
time-consuming and reliant on the willingness of the companies to
cooperate (Clauss 2017; Spieth and Schneider 2016). This study tackles
both the first and third limitation. The process of text mining 10-K
filings is not a novel concept. Hoberg \& Phillips (2016) present a
novel approach to defining industry boundaries. This is achieved through
the parsing of the product descriptions provided by firm 10-K filings
and creating word vectors. Specifically, the authors identify and
exclude proper nouns, which include common words and geographic
locations.They then create word vectors for each firm and year, which
enables the measurement of product similarity over time. In this way the
authors demonstrate shortcomings in the traditional industry
classification systems such as the Standard Industry Classification
(SIC) and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS),
which are not able to account for temporal changes. The new method is
capable of capturing changes in industry boundaries and competitor sets
over time, thereby providing a dynamic industry classification system.
In their study, Lee \& Hong (2014) examine the evolution of a firm's BM
over time. The authors thus utilize the procedure proposed by Miner et
al. (2012) to represent each document as a vector of keywords, which is
similar to the approach utilized by Hoberg \& Phillips (2016). After
identifying the Item 1 part of the 10-K filings as the most crucial part
for describing a firm's BM, Lee \& Hong (2014) filter these for relevant
sentences. Subsequently, the authors construct keyword vectors, which
represent the concept of the BM. Therefore, the evolution of the BM is
depicted as the change in the distribution of keywords over time.
Nevertheless, this approach is not without shortcomings. The authors
advocate for a more robust methodology, such as incorporating multi-word
phrases in the keyword vectors, to enhance the reliability of the
approach (Lee and Hong 2014). We therefore utilize a BERT-model in order
to

A number of studies have examined the relationship between BMI and the
financial performance of a company. These studies differ in terms of
sample size and characteristics, methodology and choice of measures
(Foss and Saebi 2017; White et al. 2022). Cucculelli \& Bettinelli
(2015) for example investigate the effect of BMI on sales growth, return
on sales (ROS) and total factor productivity (TFP) in a sample of 376
Italian SMEs in the years 2000-2010. The results provide support for the
hypothesis that BMI has a positive effect on firm performance, with the
effect increasing in line with the intensity of the innovation. Latifi
et al. (2021) use a cross-industry sample of 563 European SMEs and
provide support for the hypothesis that a company engaging in BMI will
improve its overall firm performance. In their study, the firm
performance is evaluated subjectively in accordance with the model
proposed by Venkatraman \& Ramanujam (1986). White et al. (2022)
conducted a meta-analysis based on the extant BMI literature. After an
extensive search of the literature, they identified 77 studies
comprising 26,050 firms from 26 countries and six continents. They found
a positive relationship between BMI and firm performance, and that this
relationship is shaped by factors including the firm age, industry, the
economic and political environment and BMI characteristics.

\section{Data and Descriptive
Statistics}\label{data-and-descriptive-statistics}

\subsection{Preprocessing with Gemini}\label{preprocessing-with-gemini}

As already mentioned, 10-K filings are in general very large text
documents, where Item 1 of these filings is no exception. Table 1 shows
the average, minimum and maximum length of the original Item 1 part in
our sample. In order to utilize all information regarding the BM in the
Item 1 part and pass the text to our BERT-model, we decided to let
Google's GenAI chatbot Gemini summarize them to a maximum length of 512
tokens. We inserted our prompt at the beginning of each text file and
passed it via an API to Gemini \footnote{We forked and used following
  Github Repository: https://github.com/skranz/gemini\_ex.}. We used
following prompt: ``Summarize the business model from the following
text. Answer with a continuous text and with five hundred twelve tokens
at max. Set your focus on sources of revenue, the intended customer
base, products, distribution channels and details of financing. Use only
information from the following the text''.\footnote{The spelling error
  in the last sentence of the prompt was found after processing the Item
  1. After evaluating the Summaries, this error did not cause any
  issues.} ``intended customer base'' and ``product'' refer to the value
offering, ``distribution channels'' refers to the value architecture,
and ``sources of revenue'' and ``details of financing'' refer to the
revenue model. Thus, every dimension of the definition of BMI by Spieth
\& Schneider (2016) is covered by this prompt. To check quality and
accuracy of the summaries by Gemini, we draw a random sample of 100
filings and compare the original text with the summary. More precise, we
first read the original file with a focus on the points mentioned in the
prompt above and then check, if the summary also contains these points.
A list of the sample with the summaries is in the Appendix.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  result of this check
\item
  explain why ``tokens'' not words in the prompt: mostly more tokens
  than words, BERT uses first 512 tokens. so to use the whole output of
  Gemini, text limit to 512 tokens
\end{itemize}

TODO - Descriptive Table1 for document length of original filings

\subsection{The Dataset}\label{the-dataset}

We collect 10-Ks filings from the digital SEC Database, using the
category ``10-K'' as extraction condition. Since the focus of our study
lies on company's BM, we only use the Item 1 part, since this is the
most crucial part of the 10-K filings for describing the companies BM
(Lee and Hong 2014).

//Our observations are limited to an intersection of such companies,
which on the one hand has been made available to the SEC since 2001 in a
publicly accessible list of 10.284 companies (Appendix), of which 7590
are listed (on stock exchange). On the other hand, we consider companies
that filed 10-K reports with the SEC between 2017 and 2023
//-\textgreater{} rewrite as step by step, how we got to the final list
of companies

We exclude companies from the financial sector, namely companies with a
SIC Code starting with six. We consider the filings from 2017 to 2023.
