There is significant literature on approaches to mitigate bias and promote fairness, yet the area is complex and hard to penetrate for newcomers to the domain. This article seeks to provide an overview of the different schools of thought and approaches to mitigating (social) biases and increase fairness in the Machine Learning literature. It organises approaches into the widely accepted framework of pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing methods, subcategorizing into a further 11 method areas. Although much of the literature emphasizes binary classification, a discussion of fairness in regression, recommender systems, unsupervised learning, and natural language processing is also provided along with a selection of currently available open source libraries. The article concludes by summarising open challenges articulated as four dilemmas for fairness research.},

Such systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that the decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. We have recently seen work in machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning that addresses such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming aware of the biases that these applications can contain and have attempted to address them. In this survey we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect {AI} applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined in order to avoid the existing bias in {AI} systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in {AI} showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and how they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in {AI} systems. We are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.},

	shorttitle = {The Measure and Mismeasure of Fairness},
	abstract = {The nascent field of fair machine learning aims to ensure that decisions guided by algorithms are equitable. Over the last several years, three formal definitions of fairness have gained prominence: (1) anti-classification, meaning that protected attributes---like race, gender, and their proxies---are not explicitly used to make decisions; (2) classification parity, meaning that common measures of predictive performance (e.g., false positive and false negative rates) are equal across groups defined by the protected attributes; and (3) calibration, meaning that conditional on risk estimates, outcomes are independent of protected attributes. Here we show that all three of these fairness definitions suffer from significant statistical limitations. Requiring anti-classification or classification parity can, perversely, harm the very groups they were designed to protect; and calibration, though generally desirable, provides little guarantee that decisions are equitable. In contrast to these formal fairness criteria, we argue that it is often preferable to treat similarly risky people similarly, based on the most statistically accurate estimates of risk that one can produce. Such a strategy, while not universally applicable, often aligns well with policy objectives; notably, this strategy will typically violate both anti-classification and classification parity. In practice, it requires significant effort to construct suitable risk estimates. One must carefully define and measure the targets of prediction to avoid retrenching biases in the data. But, importantly, one cannot generally address these difficulties by requiring that algorithms satisfy popular mathematical formalizations of fairness. By highlighting these challenges in the foundation of fair machine learning, we hope to help researchers and practitioners productively advance the area.},

          In recent years, the problem of addressing fairness in Machine Learning ({ML}) and automatic decision-making has attracted a lot of attention in the scientific communities dealing with Artificial Intelligence. A plethora of different definitions of fairness in {ML} have been proposed, that consider different notions of what is a “fair decision” in situations impacting individuals in the population. The precise differences, implications and “orthogonality” between these notions have not yet been fully analyzed in the literature. In this work, we try to make some order out of this zoo of definitions.},

Since they now touch on many aspects of our lives, it is crucial to develop {ML} algorithms that are not only accurate but also objective and fair. Recent studies have shown that algorithmic decision making may be inherently prone to unfairness, even when there is no intention for it. This article presents an overview of the main concepts of identifying, measuring, and improving algorithmic fairness when using {ML} algorithms, focusing primarily on classification tasks. The article begins by discussing the causes of algorithmic bias and unfairness and the common definitions and measures for fairness. Fairness-enhancing mechanisms are then reviewed and divided into pre-process, in-process, and post-process mechanisms. A comprehensive comparison of the mechanisms is then conducted, toward a better understanding of which mechanisms should be used in different scenarios. The article ends by reviewing several emerging research sub-fields of algorithmic fairness, beyond classification.},

            Word embeddings are a popular machine-learning method that represents each English word by a vector, such that the geometry between these vectors captures semantic relations between the corresponding words. We demonstrate that word embeddings can be used as a powerful tool to quantify historical trends and social change. As specific applications, we develop metrics based on word embeddings to characterize how gender stereotypes and attitudes toward ethnic minorities in the United States evolved during the 20th and 21st centuries starting from 1910.

            Word embeddings are a powerful machine-learning framework that represents each English word by a vector. The geometric relationship between these vectors captures meaningful semantic relationships between the corresponding words. In this paper, we develop a framework to demonstrate how the temporal dynamics of the embedding helps to quantify changes in stereotypes and attitudes toward women and ethnic minorities in the 20th and 21st centuries in the United States. We integrate word embeddings trained on 100 y of text data with the {US} Census to show that changes in the embedding track closely with demographic and occupation shifts over time. The embedding captures societal shifts—e.g., the women’s movement in the 1960s and Asian immigration into the United States—and also illuminates how specific adjectives and occupations became more closely associated with certain populations over time. Our framework for temporal analysis of word embedding opens up a fruitful intersection between machine learning and quantitative social science.},

We analyze two large, publicly available image data sets to assess geo-diversity and find that these data sets appear to exhibit an observable amerocentric and eurocentric representation bias. Further, we analyze classifiers trained on these data sets to assess the impact of these training distributions and find strong differences in the relative performance on images from different locales.

These predictions are used in pretrial, parole, and sentencing decisions.

We show, however, that the widely used commercial risk assessment software {COMPAS} is no more accurate or fair than predictions made by people with little or no criminal justice expertise.

Recent discussion in the public sphere about algorithmic classification has involved tension between competing notions of what it means for a probabilistic classification to be fair to different groups. We formalize three fairness conditions that lie at the heart of these debates, and we prove that except in highly constrained special cases, there is no method that can satisfy these three conditions simultaneously. Moreover, even satisfying all three conditions approximately requires that the data lie in an approximate version of one of the constrained special cases identified by our theorem. These results suggest some of the ways in which key notions of fairness are incompatible with each other, and hence provide a framework for thinking about the trade-offs between them.},

	abstract = {Simpson's paradox, or Yule-Simpson effect, arises when a trend appears in different subsets of data but disappears or reverses when these subsets are combined. We describe here seven cases of this phenomenon for chemo-kinematical relations believed to constrain the Milky Way disk formation and evolution. We show that interpreting trends in relations, such as the radial and vertical chemical abundance gradients, the age-metallicity relation, and the metallicity-rotational velocity relation ({MVR}), can lead to conflicting conclusions about the Galaxy past if analyses marginalize over stellar age and/or birth radius. It is demonstrated that the {MVR} in {RAVE} giants is consistent with being always strongly negative, when narrow bins of [Mg/Fe] are considered. This is directly related to the negative radial metallicity gradients of stars grouped by common age (mono-age populations) due to the inside out disk formation. The effect of the asymmetric drift can then give rise to a positive {MVR} trend in high-[alpha/Fe] stars, with a slope dependent on a given survey's selection function and observational uncertainties. We also study the variation of lithium abundance, A(Li), with [Fe/H] of {AMBRE}:{HARPS} dwarfs. A strong reversal in the positive A(Li)-[Fe/H] trend of the total sample is found for mono-age populations, flattening for younger groups of stars. Dissecting by birth radius shows strengthening in the positive A(Li)-[Fe/H] trend, shifting to higher [Fe/H] with decreasing birth radius; these observational results suggest new constraints on chemical evolution models. This work highlights the necessity for precise age estimates for large stellar samples covering wide spatial regions.},

	abstract = {Community detection is an important task in social network analysis, allowing us to identify and understand the communities within the social structures. However, many community detection approaches either fail to assign low degree (or lowly-connected) users to communities, or assign them to trivially small communities that prevent them from being included in analysis. In this work, we investigate how excluding these users can bias analysis results. We then introduce an approach that is more inclusive for lowly-connected users by incorporating them into larger groups. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art in terms of F1 and Jaccard similarity scores while reducing the bias towards low-degree users.},

Preexisting bias has its roots in social institutions, practices, and attitudes. Technical bias arises from technical constraints of considerations. Emergent bias arises in a context of use. Although others have pointed to bias inparticular computer systems and have noted the general problem, we know of no comparable work that examines this phenomenon comprehensively and which offers a framework for understanding and remedying it. We conclude by suggesting that freedom from bias should by counted amoung the select set of criteria—including reliability, accuracy, and efficiency—according to which the quality of systems in use in society should be judged.},

	shorttitle = {Internet Advertising},
	abstract = {Internet advertising is a fast growing business which has proved to be significantly important in digital economics. It is vitally important for both web search engines and online content providers and publishers because web advertising provides them with major sources of revenue. Its presence is increasingly important for the whole media industry due to the influence of the Web. For advertisers, it is a smarter alternative to traditional marketing media such as {TVs} and newspapers. As the web evolves and data collection continues, the design of methods for more targeted, interactive, and friendly advertising may have a major impact on the way our digital economy evolves, and to aid societal development. Towards this goal mathematically well-grounded Computational Advertising methods are becoming necessary and will continue to develop as a fundamental tool towards the Web. As a vibrant new discipline, Internet advertising requires effort from different research domains including Information Retrieval, Machine Learning, Data Mining and Analytic, Statistics, Economics, and even Psychology to predict and understand user behaviours. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on Internet advertising, discussing and classifying the research issues, identifying the recent technologies, and suggesting its future directions. To have a comprehensive picture, we first start with a brief history, introduction, and classification of the industry and present a schematic view of the new advertising ecosystem. We then introduce four major participants, namely advertisers, online publishers, ad exchanges and web users; and through analysing and discussing the major research problems and existing solutions from their perspectives respectively, we discover and aggregate the fundamental problems that characterise the newly-formed research field and capture its potential future prospects.},

Our approach is a post-processing step that can be applied to the output of any recommender system.

	abstract = {How can we learn a classifier that is "fair" for a protected or sensitive group, when we do not know if the input to the classifier belongs to the protected group? How can we train such a classifier when data on the protected group is difficult to attain? In many settings, finding out the sensitive input attribute can be prohibitively expensive even during model training, and sometimes impossible during model serving. For example, in recommender systems, if we want to predict if a user will click on a given recommendation, we often do not know many attributes of the user, e.g., race or age, and many attributes of the content are hard to determine, e.g., the language or topic. Thus, it is not feasible to use a different classifier calibrated based on knowledge of the sensitive attribute. Here, we use an adversarial training procedure to remove information about the sensitive attribute from the latent representation learned by a neural network. In particular, we study how the choice of data for the adversarial training effects the resulting fairness properties. We find two interesting results: a small amount of data is needed to train these adversarial models, and the data distribution empirically drives the adversary's notion of fairness.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of dividing items between individuals in a way that is fair both in the sense of distributional fairness and in the sense of not having disparate impact across protected classes. An important existing mechanism for distributionally fair division is competitive equilibrium from equal incomes ({CEEI}). Unfortunately, {CEEI} will not, in general, respect disparate impact constraints. We consider two types of disparate impact measures: requiring that allocations be similar across protected classes and requiring that average utility levels be similar across protected classes. We modify the standard {CEEI} algorithm in two ways: equitable equilibrium from equal incomes, which removes disparate impact in allocations, and competitive equilibrium from equitable incomes which removes disparate impact in attained utility levels. We show analytically that removing disparate impact in outcomes breaks several of {CEEI}'s desirable properties such as envy, regret, Pareto optimality, and incentive compatibility. By contrast, we can remove disparate impact in attained utility levels without affecting these properties. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the tradeoffs between efficiency, equity, and disparate impact in a recommender-system based market.},

Different papers use different notions of algorithmic fairness, and although these appear internally consistent, they also seem mutually incompatible. We present a mathematical setting in which the distinctions in previous papers can be made formal. In addition to characterizing the spaces of inputs (the "observed" space) and outputs (the "decision" space), we introduce the notion of a construct space: a space that captures unobservable, but meaningful variables for the prediction. We show that in order to prove desirable properties of the entire decision-making process, different mechanisms for fairness require different assumptions about the nature of the mapping from construct space to decision space. The results in this paper imply that future treatments of algorithmic fairness should more explicitly state assumptions about the relationship between constructs and observations.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems are an essential tool to relieve the information overload challenge and play an important role in people’s daily lives. Since recommendations involve allocations of social resources (e.g., job recommendation), an important issue is whether recommendations are fair. Unfair recommendations are not only unethical but also harm the long-term interests of the recommender system itself. As a result, fairness issues in recommender systems have recently attracted increasing attention. However, due to multiple complex resource allocation processes and various fairness definitions, the research on fairness in recommendation is scattered. To fill this gap, we review over 60 papers published in top conferences/journals, including {TOIS}, {SIGIR}, and {WWW}. First, we summarize fairness definitions in the recommendation and provide several views to classify fairness issues. Then, we review recommendation datasets and measurements in fairness studies and provide an elaborate taxonomy of fairness methods in the recommendation. Finally, we conclude this survey by outlining some promising future directions.},

	shorttitle = {Consumer Fairness in Recommender Systems},
	abstract = {Enabling non-discrimination for end-users of recommender systems by introducing consumer fairness is a key problem, widely studied in both academia and industry. Current research has led to a variety of notions, metrics, and unfairness mitigation procedures. The evaluation of each procedure has been heterogeneous and limited to a mere comparison with models not accounting for fairness. It is hence hard to contextualize the impact of each mitigation procedure w.r.t. the others. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis of mitigation procedures against consumer unfairness in rating prediction and top-n recommendation tasks. To this end, we collected 15 procedures proposed in recent top-tier conferences and journals. Only 8 of them could be reproduced. Under a common evaluation protocol, based on two public data sets, we then studied the extent to which recommendation utility and consumer fairness are impacted by these procedures, the interplay between two primary fairness notions based on equity and independence, and the demographic groups harmed by the disparate impact. Our study finally highlights open challenges and future directions in this field. The source code is available at https://github.com/jackmedda/C-Fairness-{RecSys}.},

In addition to reviewing the evaluation strategies used by prior researchers, we present empirical results from the analysis of various accuracy metrics on one content domain where all the tested metrics collapsed roughly into three equivalence classes. Metrics within each equivalency class were strongly correlated, while metrics from different equivalency classes were uncorrelated.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09030},
	abstract = {Recommender systems are used in variety of domains affecting people's lives. This has raised concerns about possible biases and discrimination that such systems might exacerbate. There are two primary kinds of biases inherent in recommender systems: observation bias and bias stemming from imbalanced data. Observation bias exists due to a feedback loop which causes the model to learn to only predict recommendations similar to previous ones. Imbalance in data occurs when systematic societal, historical, or other ambient bias is present in the data. In this paper, we address both biases by proposing a hybrid fairness-aware recommender system. Our model provides efficient and accurate recommendations by incorporating multiple user-user and item-item similarity measures, content, and demographic information, while addressing recommendation biases. We implement our model using a powerful and expressive probabilistic programming language called probabilistic soft logic. We experimentally evaluate our approach on a popular movie recommendation dataset, showing that our proposed model can provide more accurate and fairer recommendations, compared to a state-of-the art fair recommender system.},

	abstract = {Fairness in recommender systems has been considered with respect to sensitive attributes of users (e.g., gender, race) or items (e.g., revenue in a multistakeholder setting). Regardless, the concept has been commonly interpreted as some form of equality -- i.e., the degree to which the system is meeting the information needs of all its users in an equal sense. In this paper, we argue that fairness in recommender systems does not necessarily imply equality, but instead it should consider a distribution of resources based on merits and needs. We present a probabilistic framework based on generalized cross entropy to evaluate fairness of recommender systems under this perspective, where we show that the proposed framework is flexible and explanatory by allowing to incorporate domain knowledge (through an ideal fair distribution) that can help to understand which item or user aspects a recommendation algorithm is over- or under-representing. Results on two real-world datasets show the merits of the proposed evaluation framework both in terms of user and item fairness.},

In particular, this work has explored what fairness might mean in the context of decisions based on the predictions of statistical and machine learning models. The rapid growth of this new field has led to wildly inconsistent motivations, terminology, and notation, presenting a serious challenge for cataloging and comparing definitions. This article attempts to bring much-needed order. First, we explicate the various choices and assumptions made—often implicitly—to justify the use of prediction-based decision-making. Next, we show how such choices and assumptions can raise fairness concerns and we present a notationally consistent catalog of fairness definitions from the literature. In doing so, we offer a concise reference for thinking through the choices, assumptions, and fairness considerations of prediction-based decision-making.},

	abstract = {Algorithms that favor popular items are used to help us select among many choices, from engaging articles on a social media news feed to songs and books that others have purchased, and from top-raked search engine results to highly-cited scientific papers. The goal of these algorithms is to identify high-quality items such as reliable news, beautiful movies, prestigious information sources, and important discoveries --- in short, high-quality content should rank at the top. Prior work has shown that choosing what is popular may amplify random fluctuations and ultimately lead to sub-optimal rankings. Nonetheless, it is often assumed that recommending what is popular will help high-quality content "bubble up" in practice. Here we identify the conditions in which popularity may be a viable proxy for quality content by studying a simple model of cultural market endowed with an intrinsic notion of quality. A parameter representing the cognitive cost of exploration controls the critical trade-off between quality and popularity. We find a regime of intermediate exploration cost where an optimal balance exists, such that choosing what is popular actually promotes high-quality items to the top. Outside of these limits, however, popularity bias is more likely to hinder quality. These findings clarify the effects of algorithmic popularity bias on quality outcomes, and may inform the design of more principled mechanisms for techno-social cultural markets.},

This category subsumes some existing well-established areas of recommendation research including reciprocal and group recommendation, but a detailed taxonomy of different classes of multi-stakeholder recommender systems is still lacking. Fairness-aware recommendation has also grown as a research area, but its close connection with multi-stakeholder recommendation is not always recognized. In this paper, we define the most commonly observed classes of multi-stakeholder recommender systems and discuss how different fairness concerns may come into play in such systems.},

	abstract = {Modern large retrieval environments tend to overwhelm their users by their large output. Since all documents are not of equal relevance to their users, highly relevant documents should be identified and ranked first for presentation. In order to develop {IR} techniques in this direction, it is necessary to develop evaluation approaches and methods that credit {IR} methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This can be done by extending traditional evaluation methods, that is, recall and precision based on binary relevance judgments, to graded relevance judgments. Alternatively, novel measures based on graded relevance judgments may be developed. This article proposes several novel measures that compute the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. The first one accumulates the relevance scores of retrieved documents along the ranked result list. The second one is similar but applies a discount factor to the relevance scores in order to devaluate late-retrieved documents. The third one computes the relative-to-the-ideal performance of {IR} techniques, based on the cumulative gain they are able to yield. These novel measures are defined and discussed and their use is demonstrated in a case study using {TREC} data: sample system run results for 20 queries in {TREC}-7. As a relevance base we used novel graded relevance judgments on a four-point scale. The test results indicate that the proposed measures credit {IR} methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents and allow testing of statistical significance of effectiveness differences. The graphs based on the measures also provide insight into the performance {IR} techniques and allow interpretation, for example, from the user point of view.},

	abstract = {With the wide application of recommender systems, the potential impacts of recommender systems on customers, item providers and other parties have attracted increasing attention. Fairness, which is the quality of treating people equally, is also becoming important in recommender system evaluation and algorithm design. Therefore, in the past years, there has been a growing interest in fairness measurement and assurance in recommender systems. Although there are several reviews on related topics, such as fairness in machine learning and debias in recommender systems, they do not present a systematic view on fairness in recommender systems, which is context aware and has a multi-sided meaning. Therefore, in this review, the concept of fairness is discussed in detail in the various contexts of recommender systems. Specifically, a comprehensive framework to classify fairness metrics is proposed from four dimensions, i.e.,
              Fairness for Whom
              ,
              Demographic Unit
              ,
              Time Frame
              , and
              Quantification Method
              . Then the strategies for eliminating unfairness in recommendations, fairness in different recommendation tasks and datasets are reviewed and summarized. Finally, the challenges and future work are discussed.},

	abstract = {It is well understood that a system built from individually fair components may not itself be individually fair. In this work, we investigate individual fairness under pipeline composition. Pipelines differ from ordinary sequential or repeated composition in that individuals may drop out at any stage, and classification in subsequent stages may depend on the remaining "cohort" of individuals. As an example, a company might hire a team for a new project and at a later point promote the highest performer on the team. Unlike other repeated classification settings, where the degree of unfairness degrades gracefully over multiple fair steps, the degree of unfairness in pipelines can be arbitrary, even in a pipeline with just two stages. Guided by a panoply of real-world examples, we provide a rigorous framework for evaluating different types of fairness guarantees for pipelines. We show that naïve auditing is unable to uncover systematic unfairness and that, in order to ensure fairness, some form of dependence must exist between the design of algorithms at different stages in the pipeline. Finally, we provide constructions that permit flexibility at later stages, meaning that there is no need to lock in the entire pipeline at the time that the early stage is constructed.},

	abstract = {Objectives:
              Discussions of fairness in criminal justice risk assessments typically lack conceptual precision. Rhetoric too often substitutes for careful analysis. In this article, we seek to clarify the trade-offs between different kinds of fairness and between fairness and accuracy.
            
            
              Methods:
              We draw on the existing literatures in criminology, computer science, and statistics to provide an integrated examination of fairness and accuracy in criminal justice risk assessments. We also provide an empirical illustration using data from arraignments.
            
            
              Results:
              We show that there are at least six kinds of fairness, some of which are incompatible with one another and with accuracy.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Except in trivial cases, it is impossible to maximize accuracy and fairness at the same time and impossible simultaneously to satisfy all kinds of fairness. In practice, a major complication is different base rates across different legally protected groups. There is a need to consider challenging trade-offs. These lessons apply to applications well beyond criminology where assessments of risk can be used by decision makers. Examples include mortgage lending, employment, college admissions, child welfare, and medical diagnoses.},

	abstract = {We study the involvement of corporate executives in U.S. politics over the last 40 years. First, we document that the share of business politicians in federal elected office increased from 13.3\% in 1980\% to 22.6\% in 2018, with most of the increase occurring over the last two decades. Second, we find that business politicians enjoy an early fundraising advantage over their opponents, both because they are more likely to self-fund their campaigns and because they receive more campaign contributions from their firms. Third, the election of business politicians benefits their industries and firms, which experience positive abnormal stock returns when their executives win political office. We also show that business politicians, once elected, vote for policies that shift the balance of power toward corporate interests. Using close elections for identification, we show that this policy shift cannot be attributed solely to the changes in the underlying preferences of the electorate. Overall, our results indicate that corporate executives have become more involved in U.S. politics and that this involvement has benefited business interests and affected aggregate legislative outcomes.

Although the interest in business models ({BM}) has risen significantly since the late 1990s, little is known about {BMI} practices in small- and medium-sized enterprises ({SMEs}), representing a majority of enterprises in the European market. Our study addresses this research gap and focuses on the investigation of drivers and outcomes of {BMI} in {SMEs}. A partial least squares path modeling ({PLS}-{PM}) method was used to empirically test the model using data collected in 2017 from 71 {SMEs} in Slovenia. Results have shown that the innovativeness of enterprises and their business environment has a positive impact on the level of {BMI} activities in the enterprises. However, this is not the case of fast developing and rapidly changing information technology. In addition, the results show that the level of {BMI} has a positive impact on {BMI} outcomes and further on overall business performance. The results contribute to the body of knowledge in the field of {BMI} activities in {SMEs} and offer useful insights to {SMEs} that intend to innovate their business model(s) and government to create a supportive environment.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to examine the correlation between firm size, growth and profitability along with other firm-specific variables (like leverage, competition and asset tangibility), macroeconomic variable (like {GDP} growth-business cycle) and stock market development variable (like {MCR}).
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Using the {COMPUSTAT} Global database this work uses panel dynamic fixed effects model for nearly 12,001 unique non-financial listed and active firms from 1995 to 2016 for 12 industrial and emerging Asia–Pacific economies. This interrelationship was also examined for small, medium and large size companies classified based on three alternate measures such as total assets, net sales and {MCR} of firms.
            
            
              Findings
              The persistence of profits coefficient was found to be positive and modest. There is evidence of a negative size-profitability and positive growth-profitability relationship suggesting that initially profitability increases with the growth of the firm but eventually, overtime, gains in profit rates reduce, as size increases indicting that large size breeds inefficiency. The relationship between firm's leverage ratio and its asset tangibility is found to be negative with profitability. The business cycle and stock market development variables suggest a positive relationship with the profitability of firms. However, the significance of estimated coefficients was mixed and varied among different selected Asia–Pacific economies.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The study has economic implications on issues such as industrial concentration, risk and optimum size of firms for practicing managers of modern enterprise in emerging markets.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The analysis of the relationship between the firm size, growth and profitability is uniquely determined under a dynamic panel fixed effects framework using firm-specific variables along with macroeconomic and financial development determinants of profitability. This relationship is estimated for a large and new data set of 12 industrial and emerging Asia–Pacific economies.

              研究目的
              本研究擬探討公司的規模、成長和盈利能力之間的關係， 同時亦涵蓋公司特有的其它變量 （如愩杆作用， 競爭和資產的有形性）， 宏觀經濟變量 （如國內生產總值增長與景氣之循環）， 以及股市發展變量 (如{MCR}) 。
            
            
              研究的設計/方法/理念
              本研究以{COMPUSTAT} 全球資料庫、使用動態面板固定效應模型，涵蓋幾近12001間獨特的、非金融上市及活躍的公司、覆蓋期由1995年至2016年，涉及12個工業及新興的亞太經濟體。這相互關係分析研究亦於大、中及小型企業內進行，而這些企業就規模方面的分類是基於三個交替的測量而釐定的，如總資產、銷售淨額、以及企業的{MCR}。
            
            
              研究結果
              研究發現、利潤係數的持續性是正且適中不強的。有證據顯示、規模的大小與盈利能力是負相關的，而增長與盈利能力則為正相關；這暗示盈利能力初時會因企業的成長而增強，但隨著時間的推移最终當規模增大、利潤率的增長會下降，這提示我們：大的規模會導致效率低下。企業的杠桿比率與其資產有形性的關聯被發現與盈利能力成負相關。經濟週期及股市發展變量暗示與企業的盈利能力之關聯為正相關。唯估計係數的意義會因被挑選之各個不同亞太經濟體而有異和不統一的。
            
            
              實際的意義
              本研究對在新興市場的現代企業內工作的業務經理有其實際作用，因研究為他們在業務問題如產業集中度、危機、公司的最佳規模等問題上提供了經濟方面的啟示。
            
            
              研究的原創性/價值
              本研究分析公司規模、成長與其盈利能力的關係時，獨特之處是採用了動態面板固定效應模型，並於應用盈利能力的宏觀經濟和金融發展的決定因素的同時，也使用了企業特有的變量。而這關係的分析研究涵蓋12個工業及新興的亞太經濟體的龐大且新的數據集。},

            The importance of small and medium-sized enterprises ({SMEs}) increased in the recent years, particularly since 2007, with the intention to promote growth. This study aims to analyse the relationship between growth and {SMEs} and the different elements influencing this linkage. For this purpose, a systematic literature review was implemented. The analysis identifies seven factors affecting {SMEs}’ financial performance: size, age, internationalization, network, innovation, public institutions, and capital structure. These elements are significantly related with smaller firms and growth, influencing firms’ aptitudes towards performance. In addition, there seven factors could influence each other increasing the possibilities to grow. Further research investigating this literature gap is recommended.},

	abstract = {This article describes how service and manufacturing firms are different when it comes to innovation, based on a survey of firms in both sectors. Overall, four of the five hypotheses developed for comparative study of new offerings were supported by the analyses of 38 new products and 29 new services. First and foremost, there appear to be real differences between how manufacturing and services approach the innovation process, primarily because of the way organizations formalize development of new offerings in these two sectors. Manufacturing is more likely to report the need for new strategies and structures when products are new to the industry or new to the firm. However, services are more likely to convert novelty into success. Services are significantly more likely to have a short beta testing process and to exploit general manager (internally sourced) ideas for new offerings as an alternative to formal innovation structures. However, manufacturing and services exhibit a similar tendency to exploit customer (externally sourced) ideas for new offerings.
            The potential contribution of this study is to point the direction for future work in the nascent research stream of service innovation, highlighting areas where there appear to be fundamental differences between the innovation process in services and other sectors of the economy. Key differences appear to be the alternative ways services formalize the innovative process, the unique way services test customer concepts, and the combined role of general managers and professionals in the development process. These differences have managerial implications. Working closely with customers, service managers should proceed with their own unique approach to the innovative process, especially with respect to prototyping and beta testing. Senior managers in service organizations should participate in the ideation process for successful new service offerings, as part of their strategy‐making responsibilities.},

            Current literature suggests that the innovation of a business model is among the most important success factors for organizations and has a positive influence on their performance. What is not yet clear, however, is how this relationship unfolds during an organization’s life cycle. We posit that business model innovation strongly contributes to firm performance in earlier phases, but ultimately gets less important. We therefore collected data on 250 organizations in Germany and used structural equation modeling for analytical purposes. We make the following two main contributions to the literature: (1) We confirm recent findings about the positive impact of business model innovation on performance; (2) we provide first empirical evidence for the important role of life cycle stages as moderator with regard to this relationship. With respect to the latter, our findings show that business model innovation is an important pathway of organizations, especially in their early years of existence, yet somewhat diminishing over time. In conclusion, this study opens new research avenues by extending and incorporating explanations for the life cycle theory and business model innovation.},

Against this backdrop, the authors performed a meta-analysis on 276 market share-profitability findings from forty-eight studies to address whether market share and profitability are positively related and to examine the factors that moderate the magnitude of that relationship. The authors found that, on average, market share has a positive effect on business profitability. However, the magnitude of the market share-profitability relationship is moderated by model specification errors, sample characteristics, and measurement characteristics. The relationship is moderated the most (and, on average, the relationship could be artifactual) when firm-specific intangible factors are specified in the profit model or the estimate of the market share-profitability relationship is based on an analysis of non-{PIMS} businesses. The authors discuss the implications of these results for the evaluation and utilization of market share information by managers in reference to strategies that focus on building market share as a means for increasing profits.},

	abstract = {Many firms use market share to set marketing goals and monitor performance. Recent meta-analytic research reveals the average economic impact of market share performance and identifies some factors affecting its value. However, empirical understanding of why any market share–profit relationship exists and varies is limited. The authors simultaneously examine the three primary theoretical mechanisms linking firm market share with profit. On average, they find that most of the variance in market share’s positive effect on firm profit is explained by market power and quality signaling, with little support for operating efficiency as a mechanism. They find a similar explanatory role of the three mechanisms in conditions where market share negatively predicts profit (for niche firms and those “buying” market share). Using these mechanism insights, the authors show that the value of market share differs in predictable ways between firms and across industries, providing new understanding of when managers may usefully set market share goals. The authors also provide new insights into how market share should be measured for goal setting and performance monitoring. They show that revenue market share is a predictor of firm profit while unit market share is not, and that relative measures of revenue market share can provide greater predictive power.},

                et al.
                (2003) from 2000–2019. A total of 70 conceptual and empirical studies on business model innovation research spanning from 2000 to 2019 were analyzed based on different classification schemes.
              
            
            
              Findings
              The systematic review approach of this paper offers a new perspective in understanding business model innovation, bridges the gap in the extant literature by providing consolidation regarding the triggers, enablers, barriers, dimensions and outcomes of business model innovation and indicating avenues for future research.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              A review of literature on business model innovation carried out in this paper is expected to open up new horizons for future researchers to develop and empirically test frameworks related to business model innovation. The five themes identified to shed light on important aspects of business model innovation. These themes are expected to not only strengthen the theoretical foundations of business model innovation but also help practitioners develop and implement business model innovations in their organizations. In particular, the themes related to the enablers, barriers, triggers and outcomes of business model innovation can provide useful insights for practitioners.

Text mining, which essentially entails a quantitative approach to the analysis of (usually) voluminous textual data, helps accelerate knowledge discovery by radically increasing the amount data that can be analyzed. This article aims to acquaint organizational researchers with the fundamental logic underpinning text mining, the analytical stages involved, and contemporary techniques that may be used to achieve different types of objectives. The specific analytical techniques reviewed are (a) dimensionality reduction, (b) distance and similarity computing, (c) clustering, (d) topic modeling, and (e) classification. We describe how text mining may extend contemporary organizational research by allowing the testing of existing or new research questions with data that are likely to be rich, contextualized, and ecologically valid. After an exploration of how evidence for the validity of text mining output may be generated, we conclude the article by illustrating the text mining process in a job analysis setting using a dataset composed of job vacancies.},

              The purpose of this paper is to systematically analyze the literature on business model innovation by identifying its triggers, enablers, barriers, dimensions, outcomes and highlight avenues for future research.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              
                A systematic literature review of papers on business model innovation was conducted based on the recommendations of Tranfield
                et al.
                (2003) from 2000–2019. A total of 70 conceptual and empirical studies on business model innovation research spanning from 2000 to 2019 were analyzed based on different classification schemes.
              
            
            
              Findings
              The systematic review approach of this paper offers a new perspective in understanding business model innovation, bridges the gap in the extant literature by providing consolidation regarding the triggers, enablers, barriers, dimensions and outcomes of business model innovation and indicating avenues for future research.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              A review of literature on business model innovation carried out in this paper is expected to open up new horizons for future researchers to develop and empirically test frameworks related to business model innovation. The five themes identified to shed light on important aspects of business model innovation. These themes are expected to not only strengthen the theoretical foundations of business model innovation but also help practitioners develop and implement business model innovations in their organizations. In particular, the themes related to the enablers, barriers, triggers and outcomes of business model innovation can provide useful insights for practitioners.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This study is the first of its kind that has provided consolidation regarding the triggers, enablers, barriers, dimensions and outcomes of business model innovation.},

	abstract = {Business model innovation is a topic that has received much attention from academia as well as from business practice. After extensive research on the definition and conceptualization of the concept and publication of many case‐based results, recently scholars have been calling for more generalizable results, large‐scale investigations and greater empirical sophistication. Despite the great importance of measuring business model innovation for various purposes, a validated measurement scale is still not available. I fill this gap by systematically developing a new scale for business model innovation. I follow a rigorous scale development approach to ensure validity and reliability. Specifically, I collected two large‐scale samples of 126 and 232 firms to specify and assess the scale. As a result, I provide a hierarchical three‐level scale for measuring business model innovation. At the first level, 41 reflective items are provided to measure ten subconstructs of business model innovation. These can be used as formative measures of three dimensions of business model innovation at the second level, namely value creation innovation, value proposition innovation and value capture innovation. At the third level, these three dimensions form the metaconstruct of business model innovation.},

            This systematic review aims to review the effect of innovation strategy on firm competitiveness and to establish a theoretical background for future studies in the innovation and firm competitiveness literature. A total of 40 studies covering the innovation strategy and firm competitiveness were from 2015 to 2023 and analysed via a {PRISMA} method using the descriptive content analysis. These studies were found in the Scopus, Web of Science, {PubMed}, and Taylor and Francis databases. The findings from this review show that a large majority of the reviewed studies has concluded that innovation strategy have a positive relationship and effect between firm competitiveness. This study offers the chance to empirically examine innovation strategy and firm competitiveness from various angles. Despite a rapid recent increase in publications and special issue calls, many opportune research avenues within the innovation strategy and firm competitiveness field require further investigation.},

	abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence ({GenAI}) systems are being increasingly deployed across all parts of industry and research settings. Developers and end users interact with these systems through the use of prompting or prompt engineering. While prompting is a widespread and highly researched concept, there exists conflicting terminology and a poor ontological understanding of what constitutes a prompt due to the area's nascency. This paper establishes a structured understanding of prompts, by assembling a taxonomy of prompting techniques and analyzing their use. We present a comprehensive vocabulary of 33 vocabulary terms, a taxonomy of 58 text-only prompting techniques, and 40 techniques for other modalities. We further present a meta-analysis of the entire literature on natural language prefix-prompting.},

The analysis suggests that the effectiveness of a particular business model depends not only on its design (its levers and how they relate to one another) but, most importantly, on its implementation (how the levers are pulled).
